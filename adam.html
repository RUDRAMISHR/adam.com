    <h1>                                              A perfect adam                       </h1>
    <p>As the bible says the God created us in his image so it’s not only that he has two hand and humans have two hand etc. He created us like him powerful and gave us all authority to us on the earth as he can give command to things happen we also can give command to things happen. He has given us the authority on devil and demons. With Jesus name we can command anything to happen. His name is so powerful that if you have a mustard faith so you can say to mountain to move and it will move as Jesus said this. Also he gave us priority on other thing like animal birds etc.</p>
    <p>When the Adam and eve sinned they were removed from Eden garden. Then also the God loved them and didn’t leave them like that. We are supposed to be like the God but we are sinner we cannot control ourselves if we have to be creation of what God created with no sins we have to control ourselves in fact Jesus wants to control ourselves so that we became the original creation of God. Like the God created us without sin. So we need to be without sin with the anointing of God. The God is fire and he is spirit we cannot see him so he came as the Jesus because the punishments of sins was on our head but the Jesus took it on his head to have us make us like the original Adam.</p>
    <p>Original Adam is what that God made sinless and the Adam who sinned was not original Adam. The sinless Adam made by the God is the original Adam. Now we have to be original Adam with whom God talks, with who God lives, like whom God likes. We have to become like original Adam. We don’t have to become like Adam who made himself imperfect. We have to become perfect Adam as God made. There is only one in the world is perfect Adam that is Jesus Christ. He is sinless, he hasn’t sinned because he was holy, He is holy and he will be holy because he is the son of God the perfect Adam as God made.</p>
    <p>If we want to be perfect Adam so we have to be the Son of God, We have to be honest to God he will make us perfect Adam. We can’t be perfect by ourselves, The God that is mighty, God that has the glory can make us perfect, our work is to be honest to God and God will make us perfect. As he said that the land that was honest was fruitful. Our goal Is to be like Jesus Christ the son of God, the perfect Adam and we can achieve by the thing we have to honest to God as the Jesus Christ was honest to God, He never betrayed or disappointed the God because he perfect Adam as God made us.</p>
    <p>Also there was one more quality in perfect Adam. He always obeyed God as Jesus did because he perfect Adam. If we want to become perfect Adam so we have to always obey God and only follow him as Jesus did because he was perfect Adam as God loves us to see as perfect Adam that’s the reason why the God said to Jesus that he is my beloved son. If we are perfect Adam we are also the beloved son of God as Jesus was because God loves Adam but that Adam who was created by God not that Adam who was created by himself because God loves us. We have to keep God happy with our life by becoming honest to God. Perfect Adam had also one more quality that he was unto God but the imperfect Adam was unto himself.</p>
    <p>The reference of this is given in the bible in Matthew 5:48 says “be perfect as your father in the heaven is perfect”. Now if God created us in his image so the Adam was also perfect as said in the scriptures because everything in this web is based on the bible nothing is out of this book. </p>
    <p>As the God created us in his image so the Adam was also perfect. Today we are imperfect. Christian is leaving the Christ because of the troubles. Jesus said that both the houses one build on the sand and other on the concrete was hit by the flood and cyclone but the concrete house survived </p>
    <p>The trouble is hit both the holy ones and the unholy ones but the grace of God is enough to get us out of troubles as written in the bible. If we are in trouble today so it is for two reasons or by your work and not a faith in the God or because of you are growing Christian and Satan wants to test you that how much faith you have in God as happened in the life in the Job. </p>
